title: How fast can we learn?
---

In school I did not like to remember things. When I was told to learn
multiplication table, I thought - 'what a waste of time!'. Well, I was wrong in
this case and sometimes I find it very helpful. But It appears that I did not
like the multiplication table, but the process of remembering itself. And
quite hones I still don't. The process of repeating some information n times is
dull and unappealing to me. Wouldn't it be great if we could read information
one time and remember it at once?

It computer programming we have this notion of reusing code. We try to reuse our
own code, but most of the time we reuse someone else's work. This is so typical
for programming that we are not always aware of how much information we reuse.
In web development we reuse tools, frameworks, processors, compilers. Each of
these tools in turn reuses other tools up to the point where code compiled to
the binary language. Undoubtedly our work would have been much more complex if did
not have those. Image writing web program with processor instructions. These
tools allow us to write more concise program and focus only on main goal
abstracting low level interactions.  Can we do the same level of reuse in our
memory?

If we could, we probably could reuse some elements we build for previous tasks
to come up with the result for current task. I really like the analogy with
computer program here. Computer program takes an input, define a set of
commands on the input (algorithm), to receive a desired output. Our brain works
in the same way. We have an input - resources, and goal - output. The brain work
is to provide a set of commands to get to the output. What it has to do with
learning?
