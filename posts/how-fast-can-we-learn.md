title: How fast can we learn?

In school I did not like to remember things. When I was told to learn
multiplication table, I thought - 'what a waste of time!'. Well, I was wrong in
this case and sometimes I find it very helpful. But It appears that I did not
like the multiplication table, but the process of remembering itself. And
quite hones I still don't. The process of repeating some information n times is
dull and unappealing to me. Wouldn't it be great if we could read information
one time and remember it at once?

It computer programming we have this notion of reusing code. We try to reuse our
own code, but most of the time we reuse someone else's work. This is so typical
for programming that we are not always aware of how much information we reuse.
In web development we reuse tools, frameworks, processors, compilers. Each of
these tools in turn reuses other tools up to the point where code compiled to
the binary language. Undoubtedly our work would have been much more complex if did
not have those. Image writing web program with processor instructions. These
tools allow us to write more concise program and focus only on main goal
abstracting low level interactions.  Can we do the same level of reuse in our
memory?

If we could, we probably could reuse some elements we build for previous tasks
to come up with the result for current task. I really like the analogy with
computer program here. Computer program takes an input, define a set of
commands on the input (algorithm), to receive a desired output. Our brain works
in the same way. We have an input - resources, and goal - output. The brain work
is to provide a set of commands to get to the output. But what it has to do with
learning?

Learning highly depend on our memory. The more our memory capacity the more we
can learn. The more efficiently we can optimize our memory the higher capacity
it has. How can we do this? We can reuse our memory blocks. In the similar way
we reuse programming tools.

I said the process of repeating information is dull for me. But it's not exactly
right. This process is dull for my brain. It does not see a reason to repeat
something n times. When our brain does not see a reason he does not have
motivation to do it. When can you different tricks by promising our brain a ton
of money if he learns this, or repeating information before sleep, or making
exercises, or some other things. But the reality is that without motivation, or
without seeing results, our brain won't be eager to do anything. And even if
manage to remember something this way, it will quickly fade away if won't use
this information. How can we remember information better, ideally reusing other
blocks that are already stored in memory?

If we imagine process of remembering as computer program, then we would have 2
programs. 1. Program that takes data, defines a set of instructions to store
data: data -> instructions -> memory. 2. Program that loads data from memory:
memory -> instructions -> data. So it seems to save information we need a set of
instructions or algorithm. How is this algorithm looks like?

Let's look at multiplication table example. If we look at the row that multiples
everything by 1, we can quickly see a pattern that every number multiplied by one
is equal to that number or n * 1 = n. Also called identity. It seems it's not
necessary for us to remember anything here, because we know what identity is,
and we quickly can use this information to get result from n. If we look at
second row, row that multiples every number by 2, we can see a pattern too: n *
2 = n + n. So we can quickly return 2 * 4, by adding 2 fours and getting 8.
Knowing that 2 is also a double, we probably don't need to remember anything here
too. Now lets look at 8 row. Lets say we need to find out result 8 * 7. We know
that is equal to 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8. That rather hard to calculate. But
we know that 8 is also 2 * 4, so 8 * 7 = 2 * 4 * 7 = (7 + 7) * 2 * 2 = (14 + 14)
* 2 = 28 + 28 = 56. It seems we can rather easy return result of every n * n,
* where n < 10, given we know addition and multiplication logic. Or on other
    terms reusing what we already know (addition) and multiplication algorithm.
    If that is the case then we don't need to learn anything new.

You can say, but that takes time, if remember that 7 * 8 equal to 56 I will give
result right away. That's fair. But when you remember something you use capacity
of your memory and write something to it, decreasing it's capacity. While if we
have a set of rules we may not need to remember anything at all. But if we use
some value often, say calculating 2 * 2, it's result will organically be saved in
memory without our attention. This way we wouln't have to go through process of
remembering things. We just define the rules we use to get result. If we use
some operation often, result will be save in memory. If not, than we left with
memory free of information we don't need and with much better mood.




data -> instruction -> memory

memory -> instructions -> data

instructions for multiplication

instructions for book

instruction in general is just a game that we play with our mind. scientifically
proved that games increase memory

What about swithing tasks
