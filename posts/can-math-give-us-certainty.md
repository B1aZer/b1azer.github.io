It was said that Mathematics is an objective science which can give us exact
results if it has the data. Mathematics implies that our world is deterministic
and we can receive any answer for any question if we have the formula. But is
that really so?

## Experiment

Let's try to make a simple experiment. We have a 1 kg brick. It falls from
the distance of 1 m.  How much time it will take for the brick to land on
the surface of the earth?

We know that object have gravity acceleration of 9.8 m/s^2.

Given the formula from kinematic equation t = sqrt( 2 * d / g) = sqrt( 2 / 9.8
) = 0.4518 s. But when we take actual brick and drop it from the 1 m distance, we
can see that actual time differs from formal time in tens of thousands of a
second. We can then say that we did not count up for air resistance.

Given density of the air - 1.2 kg/m^3, cross sectional area of the brick
A  - 10 cm x 30 cm x 15 cm = 300 + 300 + 150 + 150 + 450 + 450 = 1 800 cm^2,
drag coefficient  - 0.82 for a brick and magnitude of the velocity squared (the
faster you go the greater the air resistance force). We can calculate time 

But even now we can see that actualt time can differ from formal time. Since we can't test
in vacuum, we have to account for factors sach as wind, surface flatness, longatitude and
latitude and so on. Mathematics can give us result good enough for our task, but this
result is not necessary exact. Is it even possible to receive exact result with formal
system?

Let's start with Georg Cantor. He gave name to infinity and said that one infinity could
be different from another infinity. He formulated continuum hypothesis and got insane
trying to prove it.

50 years later Kurt Gödel proved that continuum hypothesis can't be proved in standard set
theory. Moreover he proved that even if the formal system is complete there always will be
statements that are unprovable in that system. This  was one of major cracks in
deterministic mathematics, that showed that mathematics (and any formal system) can not be
consistent and complete.

Some time later Alan Turing reformulated Gödel work on "universal computing machine". He
stated that there was no solution to the decision problem, or it is not possible to decide
algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. Known as halting problem. In
other words it's not possible to know the result without doing the actual computation.

We can of course make heuristic approach and predict where our program will halt. Or we
can use [neural networkds](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~rickl/publications/1996-icml.pdf) for
the same purpose, which will give some probability that the program will halt. But neither
of those will give an exact answer in 100% of cases.

Fast forwarding to quantum theory. It's not a surprise for a quantum resarchers that we
can't predict a state of the system with 100% probability. Uncertainty principle is 
the root of the quantum mechanics. It states that there is a limit to the precision
with what a certain state can be predicted. Quantum engineers work with proababilites and
error corrections, not with exact numbers.

Second law of thermodynamics that the total entropy of an isolated system can never
decrease over time, and is constant if and only if all processes are reversible.
Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards the state with maximum entropy. infamous
battefly effect can be seen as example of increasing entropy.  The term is derived from
the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado being influenced by minor
perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant butterfly several weeks
earlier.

Boltzmann's introduced irreversability concept, or arrow of time, with with his equation:

!(Boltzmann equation)[{{ "assets/img/boltz.svg" }}]

System with less microstates will move to the system with more microstates, but not in
reverse. It seems logical, we need much more energy to reverse a system with more
microstates. Physicists confirm thermodynamic irreversibility in a quantum system.

We can that each unit of time number of microstates increases, and we need more energy to
reverse the system, to the point we won't have enough energy to reverse it.


Iwhat exatcly irreversability and arrow of time mean here? How bitcoin relate?

Arrow of time and uncertanty

We can see how new theories become more probabalistic and less exact. It's connected to
the size and speed of prticles they work with. It's not possible to exactly define current
of future state given our mesuremtns. Or we even can say that new theories are
non-deterministic and each new state give birth to new information and it's impossible to
predict it. Which in utrn give us an answer why we cant' connect genreal
relativity and uantuum theory, one is deterministic and worj on exact numbers,
while other is not and return probabbilites.


Be it former or latter, it became clear that mathematics is not an objective language that
can give answer to any questions and it may not be the unerversal language as we thought.
But it's just the tool we use in everyday life and this tool can give us exact enoguh
numbers.
